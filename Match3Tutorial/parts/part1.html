    //With each array being one row in our code. To get an invidual element we use board[row][column] to get an indvidual
    //element
    // ex.
    // 0: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    // 2: [7 ,8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

    //to know why compared to an 8

        //To accomplish this Phaser uses a simple tagging system, when you load an asset you give it a name, then when
        //you want to use it in a game you can simply tell Phaser to load the named asset. This allow us to only load
        //the asset from disk once
        //See: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part2

                //top left corner this will place them into a neat grid. Feel free to use a sheet of graph paper, and
                //a size of 1 to check this math
